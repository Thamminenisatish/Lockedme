LockedMe- Project Using Java

/**********************    Project and Developer Details       *******************/
This project aims to digitize the credentials for people to store their data. It was developed by Thammineni Satish using Java programming language.

Algorithms Used:
• Insertion Sort: used to sort the data in an ascending order. It is used to fetch credentials and to sort data before doing the binary search. It is an efficient algorithm with an O(n^2) time complexity.

• Binary Search: used to search for a specific credential. It is a fast algorithm with an O(n) time complexity.

• Other algorithms: some created algorithms were used in the application such as to check the duplication for usernames and sites’ names when to register and to add new site.
